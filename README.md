# Task 4: Machine Learning Model Evaluation & Optimization

This notebook is part of my AI & ML internship.  
In this task, I focused on evaluating machine learning models and optimizing their performance through preprocessing, training, and tuning.

## Dataset Used
- [Specify dataset name here, e.g., Titanic, Iris, etc.]
- Provide dataset source if available (Kaggle, UCI, etc.)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## What I Did
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure.
- Preprocessed data (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, normalized features).
- Implemented machine learning models using scikit-learn.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
- Tuned model parameters to improve accuracy and generalization.

## What I Learned
- How to select appropriate metrics for model evaluation.
- The process of improving a model’s performance through tuning.
- The role of preprocessing in building robust models.
- How visualization helps in understanding model results.

This task helped me strengthen my skills in assessing and refining machine learning models for better performance.  
Feel free to check out the notebook and suggest improvements!
